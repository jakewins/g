# Cucumber Tests

The feature files are all from the OpenCypher Technology Compatibility Kit available from https://www.opencypher.org/resources (downloaded February 2020).

Move feature files from the `backlog/` directory to the `supported/` directory to include them in testing.

To run cucumber tests simply `cargo test`
